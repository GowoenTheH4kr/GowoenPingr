# GowoenPingr
A Script for auto detection of IP, Ping Sweep and Nmap scan created using Bash. This project allowed me to understand more about Bash scripting and how to choose different columns of commands executed. ASCII art was added to bring a nice feel of the tool when used. LOL.

# Installation

chmod +x GowoenPingr

./GowoenPingr
